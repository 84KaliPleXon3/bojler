# Slicejack Email Boilerplate
This boilerplate is merely a guideline for writing HTML code that will render correctly across each of the most popular email clients.

## How to use
- Avoid using comments in your final email campaign or else you may get blocked by SPAM filters.
- Some email clients strip out `<head>` and `<style>` tags from emails, so it's best to have your CSS written inline within your markup. We know that writing inline CSS is time consuming and repetitive, so MailChimp built this conversion tool to automatically inline your email's CSS - http://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/
