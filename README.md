# Slicejack Email Boilerplate
Slicejack Email Boilerplate is merely a guideline for writing HTML code that will render correctly across each of the most popular email clients.

## Getting started
#### Use lite version of boilerplate
First of all we suggest you to use `email-lite.html` for your email development because you should **avoid using comments** in your final email campaign. Else you may get blocked by SPAM filters.

#### Follow [this](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/b/) email CSS guide
On [this link](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/b/) you can find a complete breakdown of the CSS support for the top 10 most popular mobile, web and desktop email clients on the planet. It is recommended to use it as often as possible.

#### Bring your styles inline
Some email clients strip out `<head>` and `<style>` tags from emails, so it's best to have your CSS written inline within your markup. We know that writing inline CSS is time consuming and repetitive, so MailChimp built [this conversion tool](http://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/) to automatically inline your email's CSS.

#### Test your email properly
Before you send your HTML email you should test it properly. We recommend you to use [Litmus](http://litmus.com) or [Email on Acid](https://www.emailonacid.com).

#### Send your email properly
Best way to send your HTML email would be using an Email Service Provider (ESP) such as [MailChimp](http://www.mailchimp.com) or [Campaign Monitor](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/). If youâ€™re just running a quick test we recommend you to use https://putsmail.com/
